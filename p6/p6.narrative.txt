Assignment 6
Narrative file

In my opinion, this assignment is not very hard. I use a two dimensional boolean
array to represent the adjacency matrix, and an arrayList of an arraylist to
represent adjacency list. So in my NGraphRegisterAllocator, there are two files,
one is boolean[][] adjMatrix and other one is ArrayList<ArrayList<NInterval>>
adjList. I also create a Stack<Ninterval> variable called track and an integer
variable called degree to help me doing graph allocation.

I first create a method call isInterference() to check if two NInterval is
interference. This method will go over every Nrange in one NInterval, call
isLiveAt() method to see if they are both alive.

Then I use isInterference() to help me create the adjacency matrix. It is very
easy, we can call isInterference() with two intervals, and assign the return
boolean value to the adjMatrix table. After finish creating the adjacency
matrix, I use it to create a adjacency list in buildAdjacencyList() method which
also is a helper method. I use the id of register as the index, and the
ArrayList at this index is the list of all registers that have connection with
the register. The reason why I create the adjacency list is because it is easy
to check the degree of one register, we can treat the size of the ArrayList as
the degree of the register. Then I create pruneGraph() method to remove nodes
from graph. When one node is removed, it has to be removed from every list in
the adjacency list. The removed node will push onto stack. Once we finish the
removing, we pop out the node from stack and assign the physical register to it
until the stack is empty.
